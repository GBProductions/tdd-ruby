## Description

_This program will check if two words are anagrams, antigrams, or neither. For the purpose of this program, here are the definitions we will use:_

* _Anagram:_ Both words contain the same letters in different orders. (i.e. "ruby" has the same letters "bury" has.)

* _Antigram:_ Both words have no letters in common. (i.e. "ruby" and "hello" do not share usage of any letters.)

## Setup/Installation Requirements
